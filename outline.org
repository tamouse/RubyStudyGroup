   - start with Ruby
   - plan a sequence of classes, starting with 6 weeks, "Introduction
     to the Ruby Programming Language"
   - lecture notes
   - exercises
   - live coding
   - practice
   - a small fee for the series to get some skin in the game (goes to
     WWCTC funds)



** Lesson Zero

   - editors
   - command line / powershell / etc
   - git / GitHub

    - create a project as a gem
    - review the files and folders
    - edit the ~.gemspec~
    - write the test that verifies the ~hello_world~ method

   - Modules

*** Exercises

    - create the exercise as a gem
    - edit the ~.gemspec~
    - write the tests /before/ each method

**** Exercise 2.1 String Length

    Given a string, count the number of characters in the string and
    return that value.

    - use a built-in method to calculate the number characters.
    - stretch: write your own method to calculate the number of
      characters.
    - make sure your tests include strings with spaces, puncutation,
      numbers, as well as letters.
    - make sure you test edge cases and invalid input, such as an
      empty string, a non-string, etc

**** Exercise 2.2 MadLib

     Create methods that:
     - given a template, return the fillin words as an array
     - given the same template and an array of substitute words,
       return the filled in answer.

     Make sure you test edge cases and bad data.



** Week 3

   - Organizing files
   - Using standard library
   - Using gems



* TODOS
** TODO Look at what the WWC Android and iOS study groups will be doing



* NOTES

** straw poll at WWC hack night

   Asked "Would anyone be interesed in a weekly study group on Rails?"

   Responses were nearly nil, but someone asked if it could be Ruby
   instead, and that generated interest.
