* Ruby Study Group

** Planning

*** Parameters

    - every other week (every week too much, once a month too far)
    - limit to 10 people /max/ who will commit to the full course
    - a small fee for the series to get some skin in the game (goes to
      WWCTC funds)
    - not a low-level introduction to programming course; this is a
      course in learning to program in Ruby, and adopting the idioms,
      practices, and ecosystem in the Ruby world
    - this won't include Rails, it will just be focused on Ruby itself
      (Rails can come later)

** TODOS
*** TODO Look at what the WWC Android and iOS study groups will be doing



** NOTES

*** straw poll at WWC hack night

   Asked "Would anyone be interesed in a weekly study group on Rails?"

   Responses were nearly nil, but someone asked if it could be Ruby
   instead, and that generated interest.
