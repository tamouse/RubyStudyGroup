* Ruby Study Group

** Planning

*** Parameters

    - every other week (every week too much, once a month too far)
    - limit to 10 people /max/ who will commit to the full course
    - a small fee for the series to get some skin in the game (goes to
      WWCTC funds)


** TODOS
** TODO Look at what the WWC Android and iOS study groups will be doing



** NOTES

** straw poll at WWC hack night

   Asked "Would anyone be interesed in a weekly study group on Rails?"

   Responses were nearly nil, but someone asked if it could be Ruby
   instead, and that generated interest.
